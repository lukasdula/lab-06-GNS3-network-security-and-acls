# **Network Security and ACLs**

### **Introduction and Objectives**

This lab demonstrates essential network security functions from the CCNA I/II level. It focuses on VLAN segmentation, securing switch ports, and applying Access Control Lists (ACLs) to control communication between different network segments. Each chapter builds on the previous one — starting with VLAN configuration and basic device protection, continuing with port-security, and finishing with ACL implementation on the router. The result is a secure and well-segmented network that shows the main purpose of this lab.

**Objectives are:**

- Configure VLANs and assign switch ports to the correct segments
    
- Implement basic device security including console passwords and MOTD banner
    
- Apply port-security to prevent unauthorized devices from accessing the network
    
- Configure extended ACLs to control inter-VLAN communication
    
- Verify connectivity and access control between VLANs
    



## **Lab Structure**

1. [VLAN and Basic Device Security](01-vlan-and-basic-device-security.md)
    
2. [Securing Switch Ports](02-securing-switch-ports.md)
    
3. [Access Control Lists](03-access-control-lists.md)
    



## **Key Features**

- VLAN segmentation for User, Guest, and Admin networks
    
- Device and port protection using security features and violation modes
    
- Extended ACLs controlling inter-VLAN access
    
- Troubleshooting of a sticky MAC issue affecting Admin connectivity
    
- Verification confirming correct ACL operation
    



## **Author’s Note**

This lab integrates the main security concepts from CCNA I into one topology. It demonstrates how VLANs, port-security, and ACLs work together to protect network traffic. Solving an unexpected sticky MAC issue made the process more realistic and showed how security features interact across network layers.
